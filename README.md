# 📈 Apple Stock Price Prediction

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/NadiaHafsa/AAPL-Stock-Prediction/blob/main/apple_stock_prediction.ipynb)

This project uses historical **AAPL (Apple Inc.) stock data** to analyze trends and build a predictive model that forecasts future stock prices using Python-based data analytics and machine learning techniques.

---

## 📖 Overview
The goal of this project is to understand Apple’s stock movement over time and apply predictive modeling to estimate future closing prices.  
The notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation to generate meaningful insights about market behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and analyze historical Apple stock data  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on trends, volatility, and patterns  
- Build a machine learning prediction model  
- Visualize actual vs. predicted stock prices  
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics
